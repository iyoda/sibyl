## Sibyl Test Speedup - Baseline Measurements
Date: 2026-02-18

### run-tests-parallel (BEFORE any changes)

Wall-clock time: 8.022 seconds
Total checks: 1001
Pass: 996 (99.5%)
Skip: 0
Fail: 5

Pre-existing failures (unrelated to our changes):
  - ASDF-REGISTRATION-TESTS / PARALLEL-TOOL-CALLS-ALL-RESULTS-RETURNED
  - ASDF-REGISTRATION-TESTS / PARALLEL-TOOL-CALLS-ERROR-ISOLATION
  - ASDF-REGISTRATION-TESTS / PARALLEL-TOOL-CALLS-SERIAL-EQUIVALENCE
  - ASDF-REGISTRATION-TESTS / PARALLEL-TOOL-CALLS-SINGLE-FALLS-BACK
  - EVOLVE-TESTS / MAKE-TOOL-CALL-HOOK-FORCE-OUTPUT

### Duplicate suite execution CONFIRMED

These suites ran TWICE each (once in SAFE parallel phase, once in %safe-suites-resolved):
  - AGENT-TESTS (sibyl.agent.tests)
  - EVOLUTION-STATE-TESTS (sibyl.evolution.tests)
  - EVOLUTION-REPORT-TESTS (sibyl.evolution.tests)
  - RUN-HOOK-TESTS (sibyl.agent.tests)
  - TDD-ORCHESTRATION-TESTS (sibyl.agent.tests)

### IMPORTANT: Ghost suite finding corrected

ALL 17 UNSAFE suites loaded and ran successfully.
sexp-tools-test.lisp (in sibyl.asd) contains the suites previously thought to be
in the unloaded creation-tools-test.lisp / analysis-tools-test.lisp files.
Ghost suite validation (Task 3) is still useful as a guard, but less critical.

### Target

Post-fix target: 8.022 * 0.7 = 5.62 seconds or less
Expected check count after dedup fix: approximately 1001 - (duplicate suite checks) checks
