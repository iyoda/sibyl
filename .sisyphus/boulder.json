  "note": "test-speedup plan complete as of 2026-02-18. Fixes: dedup bug (1001→908 checks), ghost validation, per-suite timing, spinner polling, REPL timing output. Task 7 cancelled (SAFE suites ~0.25s actual, UNSAFE bottleneck is inherent LLM-like test delays). 70% wall-clock target not met — bottleneck is test semantics not runner structure."
